## Intro <a name="intro"></a>
I've always disliked the existing Twitch sidebar for viewing the channels you follow. It seems to promote the higher viewed channels and with a more recent addition "recommended channels" which i believe only shows recently watched channels...

The goal of this project is to provide a more user friendly means of viewing your followed channels. This includes allowing for the ability to manage groups of followed channels, move channels around and add/delete groups, and more to come.

> Chrome does not accept manifest v2 extensions since Jan 2022, therefore this template uses manifest v3.

> Firefox + other browsers don't yet support manifest v3, so cross browser usage is not encouraged.

* Read more about Chrome manifest v2 support [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/).
* Read more about Firefox Manifest v3 support [here](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/manifest-v3/94564).

As soon as Firefox supports manifest v3, support will be added in this repo as well.
